- üé® **UI/UX**: Design improvements and user experience enhancements
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Optimize code for better performance
- üß™ **Testing**: Add or improve test coverage

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for existing issues related to your contribution
2. **Create an issue**: If none exists, create one to discuss your proposed changes
3. **Get feedback**: Wait for maintainer feedback before starting work
4. **Assign yourself**: Once approved, assign the issue to yourself

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

- `feature/short-description` - For new features
- `fix/short-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/short-description` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/short-description` - For code refactoring
- `test/short-description` - For testing improvements

Examples:

- `feature/ai-lesson-customization`
- `fix/login-validation-error`
- `docs/api-documentation-update`

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create Your Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines
- Add tests if applicable
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint:check

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Build the project

## Code Style

### JavaScript

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint:check

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting
npm run format
```

### Key Guidelines

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons at end of statements
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example:

```javascript
/**
 * Generate AI lesson plan based on user parameters
 * @param {Object} params - Generation parameters
 * @param {string} params.theme - Lesson theme
 * @param {string} params.ageGroup - Target age group
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Generated lesson plan
 */
async function generateLessonPlan(params) {
  const { theme, ageGroup } = params;

  if (!theme || !ageGroup) {
    throw new Error('Theme and age group are required');
  }

  // Implementation here
  return lessonPlan;
}
```

### HTML/CSS

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS classes
- Ensure accessibility (proper ARIA labels, alt text)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use CSS custom properties for theming

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting:

1. Test all affected functionality
2. Check responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Verify accessibility with screen readers
4. Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Future: Automated Testing

We plan to add automated testing. When implemented:

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Include end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Deployment

The application is deployed automatically to Netlify:

1. **Staging**: Pull requests trigger preview deployments
2. **Production**: Merges to `main` branch trigger production deployments

### Environment Variables

Required for deployment:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
